	cgi-lib was put in Debian policy change in 3.7.0. However this

	* Makefile: Numerous, numerous changes. Added targets: release,
	release-deb, doc, docs, sf-upload-release, install-www, list-deb.

	* bin/wwwflypaper.pl (EmailCompose): New.
	(Main): Completely new algorithm. Now shuffless all words
	to compose person's name and domain address. The AT-sign is also
	randomly places. Previously it was possible to predict false email
	address, because false "word" was always put before TLD. It
	should be fairly difficifult job for robot to tell if address
	is genuine or not.
	(SysRootdir): New. Read /etc/wwwflypaper/config if no command
	line arguments were given. This makes it possible to do system
	wide installations.
